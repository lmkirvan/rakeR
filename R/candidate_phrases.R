#' Find candidate phrases from a vector of characters.
#' 
#' This is an input to the main phrase ranking function. It's included here 
#' because it may have utility as tokenizer that allows tokenization based on 
#' arbitrary tokens and puncuation. The tokenization does not cross sentences 
#' and line breaks are treated as sentences for the purpose of tokenization.
#' 
#' @param x a character vector
#' @param split_words a vector of words to split your texts by. By defaults this
#'   calls a function that includes generated stop words.
#' @param split_punct a vector of punctuation to use in splitting your words. By
#'   default calls a function with basic punctuation
#' @return always returns a list with one element for each input text and
#'   phrases stored in a character vector.
#' @examples 
#' candidate_phrases(test_text)
#' candidate_phrases(test_text, c("the","and"), c(","," \\."))
#' candidate_phrases(test_text, NULL, " ")
